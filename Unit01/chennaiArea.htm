            <h2>Mahabalipuram</h2>
            <p>58 km south of Chennai is an ancient historic town dating to 
            the time of Periplus (1st century CE) and Ptolemy (140 CE), 
            from whence ancient Indian traders sailed to 
            countries of South East Asia.

               <p><strong>Shore Temple</strong> a structural temple with the entrance 
               from the western side away from the sea. Recent excavations 
               have revealed additional structures here.
               </p>
               <p><strong>Five Chariots</strong> 
               Pancha Rathas (Hindi) – five monolithic pyramidal structures named after the Pandavas 
               (Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishtra, Nakula and Sahadeva) and Draupadi. 
               An interesting aspect of the rathas is that, despite their sizes 
               they are not assembled – each of these is carved from 
               one single large piece of stone.
               </p>
               <p><strong>Krishna's Butterball</strong>  Vaan Irai Kal – is a gigantic granite boulder resting on a short incline in the historical town of Mahabalipuram in India. The boulder is 
               approximately 6 meters high and 5 meters wide and weighs around 250 tons.
               </p>
               <p><strong>Descent of the Ganges</strong> or Bagiratha's Penance is a giant open-air rock relief.
