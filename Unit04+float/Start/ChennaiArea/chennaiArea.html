                <p><strong>Shore Temple</strong> a structural temple with the entrance from the western side away from the sea. Recent excavations have revealed additional structures here.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Five Chariots</strong> Pancha Rathas (Hindi) – five monolithic pyramidal structures named after the Pandavas (Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishtra, Nakula and Sahadeva) and Draupadi. An interesting aspect of the rathas is that, despite their
                    sizes they are not assembled – each of these is carved from one single large piece of stone.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Krishna's Butterball</strong> Vaan Irai Kal – is a gigantic granite boulder resting on a short incline in the historical town of Mahabalipuram in India. The boulder is approximately 6 meters high and 5 meters wide and weighs around
                    250 tons.

                <p><strong>Descent of the Ganges</strong> or Bagiratha's Penance is a giant open-air rock relief.
