        <h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
        Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes only 87.97
        days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the
        messenger of the gods.

        Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from
        the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near
        the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may
        appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet
        telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner
        orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately every 116 days.

        <h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
        second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible
        to the naked eye in broad daylight.[13][14] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far
        from the Sun, setting in the west just after dusk and rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun
        every 224.7 Earth days.[15] With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
        than any planet in the Solar System and goes in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises
        in the west and sets in the east).[16] Venus does not have any natural satellites, a distinction it shares only
        with Mercury among planets in the Solar System.[17]

        <h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to
        radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.[24][25][26] Earth's
        gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural
        satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth
        rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.[n 5]

        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In
        English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'.[15][16] The
        latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
        distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[17] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
        atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts,
        and polar ice caps of Earth.

        <h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass
        one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
        combined. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity.[18] It is named after the Roman god
        Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[20]
        and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
