        <h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
        <p>
            Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes only 87.97
            days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the
            messenger of the gods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance
            from
            the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28Â°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen
            near
            the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it
            may
            appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet
            telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its
            inner
            orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately every 116 days.

    <section>
        <h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
        second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible
        to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far
        from the Sun, setting in the west just after dusk and rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun
        every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
        than any planet in the Solar System and goes in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises
        in the west and sets in the east).[16] Venus does not have any natural satellites, a distinction it shares only
        with Mercury among planets in the Solar System.

        <h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to
        radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's
        gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural
        satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth
        rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.

    <section>
        <h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In
        English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'. The
        latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
        distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
        atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts,
        and polar ice caps of Earth.

        <h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass
        one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
        combined. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. It is named after the Roman god
        Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[20]
        and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

        <h2 id="saturn">Saturn</h2>
        Saturn is distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter,
        such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume,
        it is less than a third as massive, at 95 MEarth. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less
        dense than water.
        The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 145 confirmed satellites
        composed largely of ice.
        Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity;
        they,as well as five other Saturnian moons (Iapetus, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Mimas), are large enough to be round.
        Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is bigger than Mercury
        and the only satellite in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

        <h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
        Uranus has the lowest mass of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side;
        its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation
        as each pole points toward and then away from the Sun. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets
        and radiates very little heat into space.[138] As a consequence,
        it has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. Uranus has 27 known satellites,
        the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. Like the other giant planets,
        it possesses a ring system and magnetosphere
    </section>

        <h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
        Neptune, though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive (17 MEarth) and hence more dense.
        It radiates more internal heat than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn.
        Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen.
        Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit, which indicates that it did not form with Neptune,
        but was probably captured from the Kuiper belt.[144] Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor
        planets,
        termed Neptune trojans, that either lead or trail the planet by about one-sixth of the way around the Sun,
        positions known as Lagrange points.

        <h2 id="pluto">Pluto</h2>
        <p>
            The dwarf planet Pluto (with an average orbit of 39 AU (5.8 billion km; 3.6 billion mi) from the Sun) is the
            largest known object in the Kuiper belt.
            When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of
            a formal definition of planet.
            Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and
            ranging from 29.7 AU (4.44 billion km; 2.76 billion mi) from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of
            Neptune) to 49.5 AU (7.41 billion km; 4.60 billion mi) at aphelion.
            Pluto has a 2:3 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three
            Neptunian orbits.
            Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charon, the largest of Pluto's moons, is sometimes described as part of a binary system with Pluto,
            as the two bodies orbit a barycenter of gravity above their surfaces (i.e. they appear to "orbit each
            other").
            Beyond Charon, four much smaller moons, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra, orbit Pluto.
