        <h2>About Hyderabad</h2>
        <p>
            Hyderabad is the capital of the state of Telangana. It is also the capital of
            Andhra Pradesh, but that is a temporary situation. The city is located on the banks of the Musi River. It is
            famous for its many historical monuments. The Charminar, built in 1591 CE, is a monument and mosque located
            in
            Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The landmark has become a global icon of Hyderabad, listed among the most
            recognized structures of India. (Paraphrased from <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad">Wikipedia</a>.)
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Hyderabad was founded by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 CE to extend the capital beyond the fortified
            Golconda.
            In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams
            of
            Hyderabad. The Nizams ruled the princely state of Hyderabad during the British Raj. The city remained the
            capital from 1769 to 1948, when the Nizam signed an Instrument of Accession with the Indian Union as a
            result of
            Operation Polo. (Paraphrased from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad">Wikipedia</a>.)
        </p>
        <h2>Tech Industry</h2>
        <p>
            Hyderabad is a major global center for information technology (IT) and pharmaceuticals. The city is home to
            many
            upscale restaurants and shops. Its historic sites include Golconda Fort, a former diamond-trading center
            that
            was
            once the Qutb Shahi dynastic capital. The Charminar, a 16th-century mosque whose 4 arches support towering
            minarets, is an old city landmark near the long-standing Laad Bazaar. (Paraphrased from <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad">Wikipedia</a>.)
